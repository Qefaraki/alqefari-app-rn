/**
 * Migration: Fix Storage RLS Policy Folder Index
 * Date: 2025-01-31
 * Migration Number: 008
 *
 * Purpose: Fix Supabase Storage RLS policies to use correct folder index for profile uploads.
 *
 * Background:
 * - Photo uploads use path: profiles/{PROFILE_ID}/filename.jpg
 * - Current policies check foldername()[1] = "profiles" (wrong!)
 * - Should check foldername()[2] = profile UUID
 * - Also need to verify profile belongs to user via user_id = auth.uid()
 *
 * Issues Fixed:
 * 1. Users can't upload own profile photos (wrong folder index)
 * 2. Admins can't upload photos (wrong folder index + wrong table reference)
 * 3. No ownership verification (comparing UUID to auth.uid directly fails)
 *
 * Changes:
 * - Changed foldername()[1] to foldername()[2] in all policies
 * - Added EXISTS subquery to check profile.user_id = auth.uid()
 * - Fixed admin policy to use storage.objects.name instead of profiles.name
 *
 * Impact: Photo cropping will work for regular users and admins.
