## Phase 5: High-Velocity Admin Toolkit & Backend Engine

### ‚úÖ Completed

#### Admin Edit Mode - Phase 1: Core Identity Fields (2025-09-01)

  - Clear button with smooth animations
  - Real-time validation (min 2 characters)
  - RTL support with SF Arabic font

- ‚úÖ Created BioEditor component with expanding textarea
  - Auto-expanding from 3 to 10 lines
  - Glass card design with CardSurface
  - Arabic numeral character counter (Ÿ¢Ÿ•Ÿ†/Ÿ•Ÿ†Ÿ†)
  - Smooth animations and haptic feedback
  - Internal scroll when max height reached

- ‚úÖ Created SiblingOrderStepper component (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Premium native stepper control (no blur)
  - Animated button presses with spring physics
  - Haptic feedback (light, success, error)
  - Arabic number display
  - Live preview text showing position
  - Disabled state for minus at 0

- ‚úÖ Integrated all components into ProfileSheet
  - Name editing in hero section
  - Bio editing with character limit
  - Sibling order in Information section
  - Proper data flow through editedData state

- ‚úÖ Fixed native animation conflicts in NameEditor
  - Separated animated values for different purposes
  - Used state-based styling for border color
  - All animations now properly use native driver

- ‚úÖ Fixed database constraint violations on save
  - Convert empty strings to null for nullable fields
  - Added client-side email validation
  - Properly handle all optional fields in database

- ‚úÖ Implemented efficient single-node updates
  - Added updateNode, addNode, removeNode to Zustand store
  - Tree nodes update instantly after editing
  - Real-time sync updates individual nodes, not entire tree
  - Scales to trees of any depth without performance impact

- ‚úÖ Fixed TreeView state management
  - Removed duplicate local state in TreeView
  - Single source of truth using Zustand store
  - Tree automatically re-renders when any component updates data
  - Fixes issue where edits weren't visible until restart

- ‚úÖ Created compact admin interface
  - Removed large "ÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ© ÿπÿßÿ¶ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÅÿßÿ±Ÿä" title taking up space
  - Created CompactAdminBar with native styling (no blur)
  - Single row design: user | toggle | control panel
  - Reduced header from ~200px to ~50px  
  - Added collapse option for cleaner view
  - Floating admin login when not authenticated

- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive debug logging system (2025-09-02)
  - Canvas coordinate tracking (verifies nodes never move)
  - Viewport bounds calculations with transform details
  - Node visibility transitions (entry/exit tracking)
  - Connection visibility changes
  - Pinch gesture transform calculations
  - Tap coordinate transformations
  - Node rendering position verification
  
- ‚úÖ Fixed Reanimated crash in debug logging (2025-09-03)
  - Removed inline runOnJS from useAnimatedReaction
  - Fixed segmentation fault in simulator
  - Preserved other debug logs for troubleshooting
  
- ‚úÖ Optimized debug logging to reduce spam (2025-09-03)
  - Removed per-frame rendering logs
  - Condensed all logs to single-line summaries
  - Added helpful debug guide on startup
  - Made logs easily shareable for troubleshooting

- ‚úÖ Identified and fixed zoom jumping on physical devices (2025-09-03)
  - Root cause: Viewport culling causing massive visibility changes
  - Increased VIEWPORT_MARGIN from 200 to 800 pixels
  - Added dynamic margin that scales with zoom level
  - Rounded focal points to prevent float precision issues
  - Added warnings for large visibility changes

- ‚úÖ Fixed physical device gesture handling differences (2025-09-03)
  - Issue: Physical devices send duplicate gesture events with stuck scale values
  - Added gesture debouncing to skip duplicate scale updates within 16ms
  - Implemented focal point stabilization using stored values from gesture start
  - Added 1% scale change threshold to prevent tiny updates
  - Normalized touch coordinates to even numbers to reduce drift
  - Throttled viewport bounds updates to 60fps maximum

- ‚úÖ Completely fixed zoom jumping on physical iOS devices (2025-09-04)
  - Root cause: Storing focal point at gesture start instead of using live values
  - Removed focalX/focalY shared values completely
  - Now uses e.focalX/e.focalY directly in each onUpdate call
  - Converts focal to world coordinates using transform at gesture start
  - Keeps the world point consistently under the fingers as scale changes
  - Fixed Skia transform order to scale first, then translate
  - Changed gesture composition from Simultaneous to Race with pan yielding to pinch
  - Added DPR constant (set to 1 for DIP-aligned Skia)
  - Result: Smooth, stable zoom on both simulator and physical devices

#### Admin Edit Mode - Phase 2: Visual Identity (2025-09-04)
- ‚úÖ Created PhotoEditor component with premium iOS-style interface
  - Circular photo preview (160x160) with native card
  - URL input field with live preview (800ms debounce)
  - Loading spinner overlay during image fetch
  - Error state with icon and message for invalid URLs
  - "Remove Photo" button with gradient style and confirmation dialog
  - Smooth animations and haptic feedback
  - URL validation (requires https:// or http://)
  
- ‚úÖ Integrated PhotoEditor into ProfileSheet
  - Replaces static hero image in edit mode
  - Maintains existing photo display in view mode
  - Proper data flow through editedData state
  - Seamless save functionality with backend

### üöß In Progress

#### High Priority Features to Implement
1. **Marriage Management UI**
   - Deploy admin_create_marriage function to production
   - Create MarriageEditor component
   - Add spouse selector with smart filtering
   - Implement marriage CRUD operations in admin mode

   - Field templates
   - Offline support with sync

2. Performance Optimizations
   - Viewport-based node loading
