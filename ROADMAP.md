## üéØ Remaining Work

### 1. Photo System Polish ‚úÖ
**Priority**: HIGH

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Fix inconsistent loading states across TreeView/ProfileSheet
- [x] Improve error handling and retry mechanism
- [x] Migrated PhotoEditor to expo-image (was using React Native Image)
- [x] Added blurhash placeholders and smooth transitions
- [x] Visual error states with retry buttons
- [x] Automatic memory + disk caching
- [x] Backwards compatible with both photo systems (profiles.photo_url + profile_photos table)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation in docs/PHOTO_SYSTEM_UPDATE_2025.md

**Remaining** (optional):
- [ ] Test on physical device with slow network
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for trees with 100+ photos (if needed)

### 2. Profile System & Edit Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Functional but needs refinement
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Fix any remaining save issues with specific fields
- [ ] Improve ProfileSheet bottom sheet responsiveness
- [ ] Add field-level error states and recovery

### 3. Activity Logs & Audit System Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Implemented but UI is poor, functionality untested
**Issues**:
- Poor UI/UX design - needs complete redesign
- Actor name not being tracked/displayed properly
- Functionality largely untested
- Missing proper filtering and search
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Redesign Activity Log UI for better usability
- [ ] Fix actor name tracking (who performed the action)
- [ ] Test and fix revert functionality
- [ ] Add proper filtering by action type, date, actor
- [ ] Improve performance for large audit logs
- [ ] Add pagination or infinite scroll
- [ ] Better error handling for failed reverts

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Welcome tour for first-time users
- [ ] Admin features walkthrough
- [ ] Tree navigation tips (zoom, pan, search)
- [ ] Profile editing guide
- [ ] Search/filter usage tutorial
- [ ] Consider: Tooltips vs Modal tours vs Overlay guides

### 5. Technical Debt Cleanup
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Current State**: Accumulated over development
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove all commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Delete unused components (check: QuickAddOverlay.old.js, archived components)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate functionality
- [ ] Add error boundaries to prevent crashes
- [ ] Clean up console warnings
- [ ] Organize imports and file structure
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
