**Last Updated**: October 2025

---

## üéØ Remaining Work

### 1. Photo System Polish ‚úÖ
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Complete - All components using expo-image
**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Fix inconsistent loading states across TreeView/ProfileSheet
- [x] Improve error handling and retry mechanism
- [x] Migrated PhotoEditor to expo-image (was using React Native Image)
- [x] Added blurhash placeholders and smooth transitions
- [x] Visual error states with retry buttons
- [x] Automatic memory + disk caching
- [x] Backwards compatible with both photo systems (profiles.photo_url + profile_photos table)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation in docs/PHOTO_SYSTEM_UPDATE_2025.md

**Remaining** (optional):
- [ ] Test on physical device with slow network
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for trees with 100+ photos (if needed)

### 2. Profile System & Edit Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Functional but needs refinement
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Smooth transitions between view/edit modes
- [ ] Better field validation with Arabic-specific rules
- [ ] Consistent save feedback across all fields
- [ ] Fix any remaining save issues with specific fields
- [ ] Improve ProfileSheet bottom sheet responsiveness
- [ ] Add field-level error states and recovery

### 3. Activity Logs & Audit System Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Implemented but UI is poor, functionality untested
**Issues**:
- Poor UI/UX design - needs complete redesign
- Actor name not being tracked/displayed properly
- Functionality largely untested
- Missing proper filtering and search
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Redesign Activity Log UI for better usability
- [ ] Fix actor name tracking (who performed the action)
- [ ] Test and fix revert functionality
- [ ] Add proper filtering by action type, date, actor
- [ ] Improve performance for large audit logs
- [ ] Add pagination or infinite scroll
- [ ] Better error handling for failed reverts
- [ ] Clear action descriptions in Arabic

### 4. Tutorial System
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Current State**: Not implemented
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Welcome tour for first-time users
- [ ] Admin features walkthrough
- [ ] Tree navigation tips (zoom, pan, search)
- [ ] Profile editing guide
- [ ] Search/filter usage tutorial
- [ ] Consider: Tooltips vs Modal tours vs Overlay guides

### 5. Technical Debt Cleanup
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Current State**: Accumulated over development
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove all commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Delete unused components (check: QuickAddOverlay.old.js, archived components)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate functionality
- [ ] Add error boundaries to prevent crashes
- [ ] Clean up console warnings
- [ ] Organize imports and file structure
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## üå≥ Tree Page Technical Improvements (Post-Audit)

**Last Audit**: October 2025
**Audit Grade**: B+ (Production-ready with recommended improvements)

### ‚úÖ Completed (Priority 1 - Critical)

- [x] **Remove console.log from worklet functions** (Oct 2025)
  - Fixed frame drops during pan/zoom gestures
  - Files: `src/utils/cameraConstraints.js`

- [x] **Fix stale closure in navigateToNode** (Oct 2025)
  - Removed shared values from dependency array
  - Files: `src/components/TreeView.js` line 1526

- [x] **Implement asymmetric viewport margins** (Oct 2025)
  - Eliminated horizontal pop-in issues
  - 2000px horizontal, 800px vertical with spatial grid padding
  - Commit: `2b9c27019` - "fix(culling): ‚úÖ WORKING"

### üöß Priority 2 - Next Sprint (Major Issues)

#### 6. Refactor TreeView Component
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 5-8 days
**Current State**: 3300+ lines in single file

**Problem**: TreeView violates single responsibility principle.

**Proposed Structure**:
```
src/components/TreeView/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeView.js              # Main orchestrator (~500 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeGestures.js          # Pan/pinch/tap logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeRenderer.js          # Skia canvas rendering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeNodes.js             # Node rendering by tier (T1/T2/T3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeEdges.js             # Connection line rendering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeHighlights.js        # Search + ancestry path visualization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeSkeleton.js          # Loading state components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useTreeLayout.js     # Layout calculations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useSpatialGrid.js    # Culling optimization
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useLODSystem.js      # Level-of-detail transitions
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better code organization
- Reduced risk of bugs during maintenance

#### 7. Consolidate TreeView and SimplifiedTreeView
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 3-5 days
**Current State**: ~70% code duplication between versions

**Solution**: Extract shared logic into composable hooks
```javascript
// src/hooks/useTreeRendering.js
export function useTreeRendering(nodes, connections, isInteractive) {
  return { renderNode, renderEdges, renderHighlights };
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Bug fixes automatically propagate to both versions
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Consistent behavior

#### 8. Use Design Tokens Consistently
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Current State**: Multiple hardcoded values

**Violations**:
```javascript
const CORNER_RADIUS = 8;  // ‚ùå Should use tokens.radii.sm (10)
fontSize: 7,  // ‚ùå Not in iOS scale (should be 11+)
fontSize: 11, // ‚ö†Ô∏è Use tokens.typography.caption2.fontSize
```

**Fix**: Import and use tokens throughout
**Valid iOS Sizes**: 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 28, 34

### üîµ Priority 3 - Tech Debt (Minor Issues)

#### 9. Optimize Spatial Grid Implementation
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Issue**: TreeView stores node IDs (requires Map lookup), SimplifiedTreeView stores nodes directly
**Impact**: Eliminates O(N) Map lookups on every frame

#### 10. Add Comprehensive Null Checks
**Effort**: 1 day
**Issue**: Ancestry path rendering missing some validation
**Files**: `src/components/TreeView.js` lines 2281-2401

#### 11. Fix useEffect Dependencies
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Issue**: Missing dependencies in initial positioning effect
**Files**: `src/components/TreeView.js` line 1391

#### 12. Clean Up Dead Code
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Issue**: Unreachable return statement after component
**Files**: `src/components/TreeView.js` line 2779

#### 13. Consolidate Viewport Margin Constants
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Issue**: Same constants with different comments in TreeView/SimplifiedTreeView
**Solution**: Create shared `src/constants/viewport.js`

#### 14. Update LOD Documentation
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Issue**: Comments unclear about Tier 3 usage
**Files**: `src/components/TreeView.js` lines 621-643

## ü§ù Contributing to Tree Page Improvements

When working on tree-specific roadmap items:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/tree-item-N`
2. Reference this roadmap in commit messages
3. Test on physical devices, especially for gesture/performance changes
4. Update CLAUDE.md if design patterns change
5. Add JSDoc comments for complex tree algorithms
