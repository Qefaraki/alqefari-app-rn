## üéØ Remaining Work

### 1. Photo System Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Working but fidgety behavior
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix inconsistent loading states across TreeView/ProfileSheet
- [ ] Improve error handling and retry mechanism
- [ ] Remove URL-based photo code (technical debt in PhotoEditor.js)
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for trees with many photos
- [ ] Fix Supabase image transformation or implement proper fallback

### 2. Profile System & Edit Polish
**Priority**: HIGH
**Current State**: Functional but needs refinement
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Smooth transitions between view/edit modes
- [ ] Better field validation with Arabic-specific rules
- [ ] Consistent save feedback across all fields
- [ ] Fix any remaining save issues with specific fields
- [ ] Improve ProfileSheet bottom sheet responsiveness
- [ ] Add field-level error states and recovery

### 3. Tutorial System
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Current State**: Not implemented
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Welcome tour for first-time users
- [ ] Admin features walkthrough
- [ ] Tree navigation tips (zoom, pan, search)
- [ ] Profile editing guide
- [ ] Search/filter usage tutorial
- [ ] Consider: Tooltips vs Modal tours vs Overlay guides

### 4. Technical Debt Cleanup
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Current State**: Accumulated over development
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove all commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Delete unused components (check: QuickAddOverlay.old.js, archived components)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate functionality
- [ ] Add error boundaries to prevent crashes
- [ ] Clean up console warnings
- [ ] Organize imports and file structure
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
