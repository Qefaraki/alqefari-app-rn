## Critical Issues Found üö®

### 1. Alert Format Bug (Line 122)

**Current Code**:
```javascript
Alert.alert("ÿÆÿ∑ÿ£", "ŸÅÿ¥ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ©");
onClose();
```

**Fix Required**:
```javascript
Alert.alert("ÿÆÿ∑ÿ£", "ŸÅÿ¥ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ©", [
  { text: "ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜÿßŸã", onPress: () => onClose() }
]);
```

**Impact**: iOS dismiss button doesn't work correctly

---

## What Works Well ‚úÖ

1. **Search Logic** - Perfect filtering (gender, HID, max results)
2. **Name Detection** - Correctly identifies Al-Qefari vs non-Qefari
3. **UI States** - Loading, empty, error states all render correctly
4. **Validation** - Rejects invalid inputs properly
5. **Haptics** - Feedback triggers at right moments

---

## What Needs Work ‚ùå

1. **Integration Flows** - Tree modal ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Marriage creation
   - **Solution**: Add Playwright E2E tests

2. **Success States** - Auto-dismiss and callback execution
   - **Solution**: Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` or E2E tests

3. **Complex Edge Cases** - Race conditions, concurrent operations
   - **Solution**: Better mock setup + integration tests

---

## Quick Recommendations

### Must Do Before Merge
- [ ] Fix Alert.alert format bug
- [ ] Update deprecated `container` to `root` in test

### Should Do This Sprint
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E test for full flow
- [ ] Create reusable mock factories
- [ ] Test on real device (haptics, RTL)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Refactor async logic into service layer
- [ ] Add testID props to key elements
- [ ] Expand edge case coverage

## Manual Test Checklist

Before releasing to production, manually verify:

- [ ] Search works with Arabic names (with diacritics)
- [ ] Haptic feedback feels appropriate (physical device)
- [ ] RTL layout looks correct (all screen sizes)
- [ ] Network errors display properly
- [ ] Success animation plays smoothly
- [ ] Auto-dismiss timing feels natural (1.5s)
- [ ] Concurrent spouse addition is prevented
- [ ] Very long names don't break layout

**Overall Grade: B+ (85/100)**

Core functionality is solid. Main gaps are in complex integration testing.

---

**Next Action**: Fix Alert.alert bug, then consider E2E tests for full coverage.
