# Pre-Production Test Plan
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing before wiping test data and adding real family information.

**Status**: üö® **DRAFT - NOT STARTED**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Data Integrity Tests

These tests protect against data loss, corruption, or relationship breaking.

### 1. Cascade Delete System (Migration 084b)
**Risk**: Could accidentally delete entire family branches permanently.

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] **1.1** Delete profile with 0 descendants
  - Expected: Single profile deleted, no cascade
  - Verify: Profile has `deleted_at` timestamp
  - Verify: Audit log has entry with `batch_id`

- [ ] **1.2** Delete profile with 1-5 descendants (small branch)
  - Expected: Parent + all descendants soft-deleted
  - Verify: All profiles have same `deleted_at` timestamp
  - Verify: All entries share same `batch_id` in audit log
  - Verify: UI shows correct descendant count warning

- [ ] **1.3** Delete profile with 6-20 descendants (medium branch)
  - Expected: Cascade delete with "permanent but recoverable" warning
  - Verify: Correct generation count shown in UI
  - Verify: All descendants deleted recursively
  - Verify: Related marriages soft-deleted

- [ ] **1.4** Attempt to delete profile with >100 descendants
  - Expected: Error "ÿπÿØÿØ ŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¥ÿÆÿßÿµ"
  - Verify: Operation fails gracefully
  - Verify: No partial deletions occurred

- [ ] **1.5** Concurrent delete protection
  - Setup: User A opens profile for edit
  - Action: User B attempts to delete same profile
  - Expected: "ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÅ ŸÇŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπÿØŸäŸÑ" error
  - Verify: Deletion blocked by row-level lock

- [ ] **1.6** Version conflict handling
  - Setup: Profile at version 5
  - Action: Call cascade delete with version 3
  - Expected: "ÿ™ŸÖ ÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸäÿßŸÜÿßÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿØŸÖ ÿ¢ÿÆÿ±"
  - Verify: No deletion occurred

- [ ] **1.7** Permission validation across descendants
  - Setup: User has inner permission on parent, but not grandchild
  - Action: Attempt cascade delete
  - Expected: "ŸÑŸäÿ≥ ŸÑÿØŸäŸÉ ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠Ÿäÿ© ŸÑÿ≠ÿ∞ŸÅ ÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¥ÿÆÿßÿµ"
  - Verify: No partial deletions

- [ ] **1.8** Recovery audit trail
  - Action: Delete branch of 10 people

  - Verify: Metadata includes profile names and HIDs
  - Verify: All entries have identical timestamp

**Database Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check soft-deleted profiles
SELECT id, name, hid, deleted_at
FROM profiles

SELECT metadata->>'batch_id' as batch_id,
       COUNT(*) as deleted_count,
       MIN(created_at) as deletion_time
FROM audit_log_enhanced
WHERE action = 'CASCADE_DELETE'
GROUP BY batch_id
ORDER BY deletion_time DESC;

-- Verify no orphaned children
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.father_id, c.mother_id
FROM profiles c
WHERE (c.father_id IN (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
   OR c.mother_id IN (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL))

  - Verify: All grandchildren have generation = 3

- [ ] **9.4** Deep lineage (5+ generations)
  - Setup: Create profiles down to generation 6
  - Verify: Each generation increments correctly

- [ ] **9.5** Munasib generation
  - Setup: Munasib wife has no father
  - Question: What should generation be? NULL or inferred from spouse?
  - Verify: Consistent behavior

**Database Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check generation distribution
SELECT generation, COUNT(*) as count
FROM profiles
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY generation
ORDER BY generation;

-- Verify parent-child generation increments
SELECT
  c.name as child_name,
  c.generation as child_gen,
  f.name as father_name,
  f.generation as father_gen,
  c.generation - f.generation as gen_diff
FROM profiles c
JOIN profiles f ON f.id = c.father_id
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND f.deleted_at IS NULL;
-- All gen_diff should be 1

-- Find generation mismatches
SELECT
  c.id, c.name, c.generation as calc_gen,
  f.generation + 1 as expected_gen
FROM profiles c
JOIN profiles f ON f.id = c.father_id
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND f.deleted_at IS NULL
