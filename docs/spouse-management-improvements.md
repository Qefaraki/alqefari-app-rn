# Spouse Management System Improvements

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the spouse management system to improve privacy, usability, and cultural sensitivity.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Privacy Enhancements
- **No spouse names on adult profiles**: Adults (both male and female) never show spouse names
- **Only marital status displayed**: Shows "متزوج" or "مطلق" status only
- **Parent relationships through children**: Parents are only revealed through their children's profiles
- **Admin-only spouse management**: Full spouse details only visible in admin mode

### 2. MunasibManager Improvements
- **Removed chevron arrows**: Family cards are buttons, not navigation items
- **Full name chains**: Displays complete genealogy (e.g., "محمد بن عبدالله عبدالعزيز القفاري")
- **Proper ancestry traversal**: Uses father_id links to build accurate family chains
- **Family statistics**: Shows count of members from each family

### 3. New SpouseManager Component
Replaced confusing MarriageEditor with intuitive SpouseManager:
- **Clear mode toggle**: "Search existing" vs "Add new" modes
- **Visual feedback**: Selected spouse highlighted with checkmark
- **Smart search**: Filters by appropriate gender automatically
- **Family name extraction**: Automatically extracts family origin from names
- **No "unselected" confusion**: Clear UI that grandparents and kids can use

### 4. Database Function Fixes
- **admin_create_marriage**: Fixed missing p_wife_id parameter issue
- **Schema cache handling**: Force recreation to ensure PostgREST picks up changes
- **Parameter validation**: Added checks to ensure required fields are present

### 5. Data Consistency
- **Unified marriage data structure**: Consistent fields across RPC and fallback queries
- **Key prop fixes**: Ensured all marriages have valid id fields for React
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains support for both old and new data formats

### 6. Parent Display
- **Father display**: Already showing in ProfileSheet
- **Mother display**: Added mother (الوالدة) display alongside father
- **Both parents visible**: Children now properly show both parents

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/admin/MunasibManager.js` - UI improvements
2. `src/components/admin/FamilyDetailModal.js` - Full name chains
3. `src/components/admin/SpouseManager.js` - New intuitive component
4. `src/components/ProfileSheet.js` - Added mother display, privacy enforcement
5. `src/services/profiles.js` - Data consistency fixes

### Database Changes
- Redeployed `admin_create_marriage` function with all parameters
- Fixed schema cache issues through drop/recreate strategy

## Cultural Considerations
The system respects the principle: "The mother's always the mother, but wife might not always be a wife"
- Permanent parent relationships shown through children
- Spouse relationships kept private on adult profiles
- Maintains family dignity and privacy

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new spouse (Munasib) profile
- [ ] Link existing spouse to person
- [ ] View family statistics in MunasibManager
- [ ] Verify full name chains in FamilyDetailModal
- [ ] Check parent display on children's profiles
- [ ] Confirm spouse privacy on adult profiles
- [ ] Test in both admin and public modes

## Future Considerations
- Migration path for existing spouse data
- Enhanced Munasib reporting features
- Family connection visualizations
- Automated family origin detection improvements
