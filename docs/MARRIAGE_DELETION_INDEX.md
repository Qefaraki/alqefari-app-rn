## Critical Questions Needing Answers

Before implementation, stakeholders must answer these 6 questions:

1. **Should we keep mother references after divorce?**
   - Yes: Keep intact (preserves biological truth)
   - No: Clear to NULL (clean break)
   - Maybe: Mark as "former mother" (hybrid)

2. **How long should deletions be undoable?**
   - Unlimited (like regular updates)
   - 30 days (current policy for users)
   - 7 days (for admin actions only)

3. **Should we prevent deletion if children are Al-Qefari?**
   - Yes: Require special approval (safety)
   - No: Allow if admin wants it (trust)

4. **For cousin marriages, show both parents?**
   - Yes: Always show complete family tree (genealogy)
   - No: Just show father if marriage dissolved (clarity)

5. **Require admin review for large deletions?**
   - Yes: If >2 children affected (safety)
   - No: Admin is trusted (efficiency)

6. **Update schema in future?**
   - Add birth_mother_id (biological history)
   - Add mother_id_deleted_at (soft-delete tracking)
   - Add marriages.status field (marriage state)
   - Or stay with metadata approach?
