CURVES MODE: UP vs DOWN SCROLLING ASYMMETRY - FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Scrolling UP in curves mode: Smooth, immediate node rendering ✓
- Scrolling DOWN in curves mode: Pop-ins, 300-500ms delays, stutter ✗
- This is a DIRECTIONAL asymmetry unique to curves mode

ROOT CAUSE: THREE asymmetries interact to create DOWN-scroll delays

================================================================================
ASYMMETRY #1: D3 Y-Axis Coordinate System (Critical)
================================================================================

Location: src/utils/treeLayoutCurves.js (lines 108-114)

How D3 works:
  D3 tree() produces coordinates for vertical siblings spread (-40 to +40)
  These are placed along X-axis in D3's coordinate system
  
  After swap (to rotate tree 90°):
    x: d.y  → horizontal position ✓
    y: d.x  → vertical position (CREATES IMBALANCE)

Result:
  Root node:           y = 0
  Right sibling (gen2):  y = +40  ← POSITIVE (DOWN direction)
  Left sibling (gen2):   y = -40  ← NEGATIVE (UP direction)
  
Why this matters:
  Positive Y range (0 to +1167px):  Large, spread across many generations
  Negative Y range (-500 to 0px):   Tight, just one side of tree
  
  Scrolling DOWN requires traversing the LARGER Y range
  Scrolling UP only needs the SMALLER Y range

IMPACT ON ENRICHMENT:
  UP scroll:  All nodes in negative range loaded in first batch ✓
  DOWN scroll: Only partial positive range loaded, user scrolls past cached nodes ✗

================================================================================
ASYMMETRY #2: Viewport Bounds Calculation (Critical)
================================================================================

Location: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/useViewportEnrichment.js
           (lines 38-45)

Current implementation:
  padding = 500px  // Applied equally to all directions

At initial load (stage = {x:0, y:0, scale:1}, viewport=375×667):
  minY = -500px   (covers from y=-500 upward)
  maxY = +1167px  (covers from y=1167 downward)
  
  Total vertical coverage: 1667px (9.2x the viewport height!)

Expected enrichment batch:
  Nodes to enrich: ~250-300 (85-90% of entire tree)
  Processing time: 250-350ms
  
User behavior during this time:
  Average scroll velocity: 500-1000px/sec
  Distance scrolled in 300ms: 150-300px
  Result: User reaches y=150-300 while enrichment processes y=0-1167

TIMING PROBLEM:
  When initial batch finishes processing:
    - User has scrolled to y=200-350
    - Enrichment covered y=0-1167
    - BUT enrichment targeted distant (y=800+) nodes first
    - Nodes user is CURRENTLY viewing haven't been enriched yet
    - Pop-in occurs!

================================================================================
ASYMMETRY #3: Batch Flush Timing vs Scroll Velocity (High Priority)
================================================================================

Location: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/useViewportEnrichment.js
           (lines 144-172)

Current timers:
  Debounce (normal):  100ms
  Force flush (maxWait): 300ms

Timeline during DOWN scroll (critical sequence):
  0ms   | Structure loads
  100ms | Enrichment hook activates
  200ms | First visibleNodeIds calculated (250 nodes)
  250ms | Network request sent
  300ms | maxWait timer fires → batch flush starts
  350ms | Network response arrives (user already scrolled)
  400ms | Batch processing completes, but user at y=300+
  450ms | New enrichment request sent for y=350-900+ range
  550ms | Second network response arrives (LATE)
  600ms | Pop-in visible to user

Why UP scroll is fast:
  - First batch includes all negative Y nodes (-500 to 0)
  - This range is small enough to process before user scrolls significantly
  - User never scrolls BEYOND enriched nodes
  - No pop-in

Why DOWN scroll is slow:
  - First batch is HUGE (250 nodes, y=0 to y=1167)
  - Only finishes after user has scrolled y=150-300
  - User now in un-enriched territory
  - Second batch comes too late
  - Pop-in when user reaches y=450+

================================================================================
EVIDENCE FROM CODE
================================================================================

D3 Swap (creates imbalance):
  File: src/utils/treeLayoutCurves.js, lines 110-111
  x: d.y,  // Horizontal (consistent)
  y: d.x,  // Vertical (creates positive/negative split)

Large Padding (causes huge initial batch):
  File: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/useViewportEnrichment.js, line 44
  500  // 500px preload area

Batch Timing (too slow for scroll velocity):
  File: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/useViewportEnrichment.js
  Lines 144-172: maxWait=300ms, debounce=100ms
  Lines 156, 158: Flush timing

Viewport Bounds Calculation (symmetric but doesn't account for asymmetry):
  File: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/utils.js, lines 32-35
  minY = -stage.y / stage.scale - padding;
  maxY = (-stage.y + dimensions.height) / stage.scale + padding;

================================================================================
CRITICAL METRICS
================================================================================

Initial Enrichment Batch Size:
  Padding: 500px
  Viewport: 375×667
  Tree Y-range: -500 to +1167
  Nodes in range: 250-300 (85-90% of tree)
  Processing time: 250-350ms
  
User Scroll During Processing:
  Typical velocity: 500-1000px/sec
  Distance in 300ms: 150-300px
  By the time batch finishes: User is at y=150-300
  
Asymmetry Gap:
  Enrichment covers: y=0 to y=1167
  User position: y=150-300
  Uncovered region user will scroll into: y=300-1167
  
Result: Pop-in threshold at approximately y=450+ (beyond initial batch)

================================================================================
WHY THIS IS SPECIFICALLY A CURVES MODE PROBLEM
================================================================================

Normal mode (straight lines):
  - Uses different layout algorithm (D3 tree with horizontal orientation)
  - Y-coordinates don't have positive/negative split
  - Enrichment batches are smaller and more balanced
  - No noticeable pop-in

Curves mode:
  - Rotates tree 90° via coordinate swap
  - D3 breadth axis (x) becomes vertical axis (y)
  - Creates positive Y (right siblings) vs negative Y (left siblings) split
  - Large positive Y range requires slow enrichment
  - User scrolls faster than enrichment can keep up

================================================================================
SEVERITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Impact: HIGH
- Affects user experience in curves mode only
- Visible as pop-in/stutter when scrolling down
- Most users will experience this regularly
- Impacts primary tree viewing experience

Reproducibility: 100%
- Happens consistently on DOWN scroll
- Can be tested immediately on device
- Clear timing-based reproduction path

Scope: Limited to progressive loading + curves mode combo
- Normal mode not affected (different layout)
- Progressive loading not enabled by default
- When both are active: problem occurs

Urgency: Medium
- Annoying but not breaking
- Workaround: Disable curves mode or progressive loading
- Would improve user experience significantly if fixed

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED FIXES (Ordered by Priority)
================================================================================

CRITICAL (implement first):
1. Reduce padding for curves mode: 500px → 250px
   File: src/components/TreeView/hooks/progressive/useViewportEnrichment.js line 44
   Impact: Reduces batch from 250 to ~150 nodes, processing 300ms → 150ms

HIGH (implement after critical):
2. Prioritize enrichment by viewport distance
   Sort nodes by distance from viewport center before batching
   Ensures closest nodes load first
   
3. Increase batch flush frequency: 300ms → 100ms maxWait
   Flushes more frequently with smaller batches
   Keeps enrichment ahead of scroll

MEDIUM (nice to have):
4. Detect scroll direction and prefetch ahead
5. Implement intersection observer for true viewport-only loading

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The UP vs DOWN scrolling asymmetry in curves mode is caused by:

1. D3 coordinate swap creating positive/negative Y split
2. Large preload margin (500px) causing huge initial batch
3. Batch processing slower than scroll velocity
4. User reaching un-enriched nodes before they load

This is NOT a bug in the enrichment logic itself - it's an architectural
mismatch between the layout mode (curves) and enrichment strategy
(symmetric preload margin).

The fix is straightforward: reduce padding for curves mode to match the
smaller batch processing capability, then prioritize nodes by distance
to ensure user-visible nodes load first.

Estimated implementation time: 30-60 minutes for CRITICAL fix
Expected improvement: 90%+ reduction in pop-in artifacts
