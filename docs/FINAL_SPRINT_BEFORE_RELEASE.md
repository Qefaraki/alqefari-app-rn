## Day 1: Country/City Selector Fix (Oct 25)

**Status**: ✅ Complete (FINAL SOLUTION)

### Problems Identified

**Problem 1: UUID Error "invalid input syntax for uuid: 2"**
- Root cause: Sending `current_residence_normalized` with nested objects containing numeric IDs to RPC
- `city.id: 2` was being cast as UUID → PostgreSQL error
- **Solution**: Stop sending normalized data to RPC entirely

**Problem 2: Country Selector Flashing**
- Root cause: Overcomplicated state sync between `current_residence` and `current_residence_normalized`
- **Solution**: Use simple local state for display, send only strings to database

### Final Simplified Architecture

**Storage** (Database only):
- `current_residence` = Plain Arabic strings (no emoji, no nested objects)
  - Saudi with city: `"الرياض"`
  - Other country: `"مصر"`

**Display** (Local React State):
- `selectedCountry` = Local state for CountryPicker
- `selectedCity` = Local state for SaudiCityPicker
- Pickers read from local state, not form draft
- No sync issues because they're independent

**On Save**:
- Remove `current_residence_normalized` from RPC payload
- Send only `current_residence` (simple string)
- No UUID errors, no nested objects

### Implementation

**TabDetails.js Changes**:
```javascript
const [selectedCountry, setSelectedCountry] = useState(draft?.current_residence || '');
const [selectedCity, setSelectedCity] = useState('');

<CountryPicker
  value={selectedCountry}
  onChange={(country) => {
    setSelectedCountry(country);
    if (!country.includes('السعودية')) setSelectedCity('');
    updateField('current_residence', country);
  }}
/>

<SaudiCityPicker
  value={selectedCity}
  onChange={(city) => {
    setSelectedCity(city);
    updateField('current_residence', city);
  }}
  enabled={selectedCountry.includes('السعودية')}
/>
```

**ProfileViewer.js Changes**:
```javascript
// Simply delete normalized data before RPC
delete payload.current_residence_normalized;
```

### Testing Status
✅ Country selector doesn't flash
✅ City picker only enabled when Saudi selected
✅ No UUID errors on save
✅ Simple Arabic strings stored in database
✅ No nested objects, no emoji, no IDs sent to RPC

### Why This is Better

1. **No complexity**: Just strings, no normalization
2. **No sync issues**: Local state independent from form
3. **No errors**: Numeric IDs never sent to RPC
4. **Maintainable**: Anyone can understand the code
5. **Best practice**: Separation of display state and database state

### Commits
1. `d8897f5f2`, `bf967531e`, `d331fc3d7`, `5d2b799a8` - Previous attempts (iterations)
2. `8f42e29de` - **FINAL**: "fix: Simplify country/city selector - remove overcomplicated normalization"
   - Removes normalization entirely
   - Uses simple local state
   - Deletes normalized data from RPC
   - Clean, simple, maintainable
