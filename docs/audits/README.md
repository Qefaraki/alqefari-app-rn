# Phase Audits

This directory contains solution audit reports for each phase of the Perfect Tree implementation.

## Purpose

After each phase completes, the solution-auditor agent reviews:
- Architecture alignment with specification
- Code quality and best practices
- Performance implications
- Edge cases and error handling
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage

## Structure

Each audit is named: `PHASE_X_AUDIT.md`

Example:
```
PHASE_1_AUDIT.md   # Foundation phase audit
PHASE_2_AUDIT.md   # Visual polish phase audit
PHASE_3_AUDIT.md   # Theme system phase audit
```

## Workflow

1. Phase completes
2. Run: `solution-auditor` agent
3. Create audit document with findings
4. User reviews and tests
5. Fix issues from audit + user testing
6. Mark phase as complete
