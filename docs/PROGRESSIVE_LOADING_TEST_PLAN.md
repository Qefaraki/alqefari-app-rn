2. **Progressive Mode** (new): `USE_PROGRESSIVE_LOADING = true`

---

## Phase 1: Structure Loading Tests

### 1.1 Structure Load Time (Progressive Mode)
**Objective**: Verify Phase 1 loads 0.45 MB in <500ms

**Steps**:
1. Set `USE_PROGRESSIVE_LOADING = true`
2. Hard-restart app (clear cache)
3. Monitor console output for:
   - `üì¶ [Phase 1] Loading tree structure...`
   - `‚úÖ [Phase 1] Structure loaded: X profiles (Y MB) in Zms`
4. Verify load time < 500ms
5. Verify data size ‚âà 0.45 MB (158 bytes/profile)

**Expected Output**:
```

‚úÖ [Phase 1] Structure loaded: 2850 profiles (0.45 MB) in 350ms
```

**Pass Criteria**:

2. Restart app (don't clear cache)
3. Verify console shows:
   - `üöÄ [Phase 1] Using cached structure`
4. Measure load time (should be <50ms)

**Expected Output**:

3. Monitor console for:
   - `üì¶ [Phase 3] Enriching N visible nodes...`
   - `‚úÖ [Phase 3] Enriched N nodes in Yms`
4. Verify only visible + padding nodes enriched
5. Scroll to different region, verify different nodes enriched

**Expected Output**:
```
üì¶ [Phase 3] Enriching 42 visible nodes...
‚úÖ [Phase 3] Enriched 42 nodes in 125ms
```

**Pass Criteria**:

4. Verify text-only nodes still display (no photos for some)

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Photos display correctly
- [ ] Bio and metadata populated
- [ ] No "loading" states after enrichment
- [ ] Quick response when tapping enriched nodes

---

### 3.3 Progressive Photo Loading
**Objective**: Verify photos load progressively without jumping

**Steps**:
1. Launch app with progressive loading

   - [ ] First: Structure visible (minimal rendering)
   - [ ] Then: Layout calculated (all positions set)
   - [ ] Then: Photos progressively appear as you scroll
3. Note timing for each phase
4. Verify smooth progression (no stuttering)

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Photos load without affecting layout
- [ ] Smooth visual progression
- [ ] No rendering performance degradation
- [ ] Responsive during enrichment

## Performance Comparison Tests

### 4.1 Progressive vs Traditional Load Time
**Objective**: Compare overall time to interactive state

**Setup**:
- Test 1: Traditional mode
- Test 2: Progressive mode
- Clear app cache between tests

**Measurement Points**:
```
Traditional Mode:
- Load start ‚Üí Complete tree loaded ‚Üí Ready to interact
- Measure: Total time

Progressive Mode:
- Load start ‚Üí Structure + Layout ‚Üí Ready to interact
- Measure: Time to Phase 2 complete (layout ready)
- Note: Phase 3 (enrichment) happens in background
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Hard restart app (clear cache)
2. Record wall-clock time from app launch to:
   - Complete layout rendering
   - Ability to scroll/interact
3. Repeat 5 times, average results

**Expected Improvement**:
```
Traditional: ~1.3s to interactive (full tree load + layout)
Progressive: ~0.85s to interactive (structure + layout)
Improvement: ~35% faster to first interaction
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Progressive mode faster to interactive state
- [ ] Difference measurable (>10% improvement)
- [ ] Consistent across repeated tests

### 4.2 Memory Usage
**Objective**: Verify memory savings with progressive loading

**Steps** (iOS):
1. Open Xcode ‚Üí Memory Report
2. Traditional mode: Record memory after full tree loaded
3. Progressive mode: Record memory after Phase 2 (layout complete)
4. Compare peak memory usage

**Expected Memory Usage**:
```
Traditional: ~15-20 MB (full tree in memory)
Progressive (Phase 2): ~6-8 MB (structure only)
Progressive (After Phase 3): ~12-15 MB (structure + enriched visible)

Savings: ~25-30% peak memory reduction
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Progressive mode uses less peak memory
- [ ] Memory growth matches enrichment (visible nodes)
- [ ] No memory leaks over time

---

### 4.3 Data Transfer Reduction
**Objective**: Verify network bandwidth savings

**Monitoring** (Network tab):
1. Traditional mode: Record total bytes downloaded
2. Progressive mode: Record bytes per phase

**Expected Data Transfer**:
```
Traditional: ~4.26 MB (full tree with all photos)
Progressive Phase 1: ~0.45 MB (structure only)
Progressive Phase 3: ~3.5 MB (enriched visible + photos)

Phase 1 Reduction: 89.4% less initial download
Phase 3 Progressive: Only fetch visible photos
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1 download < 0.5 MB
- [ ] Phase 3 downloads only enriched nodes
- [ ] Total bandwidth similar or better than traditional

   - [ ] List of issues found
   - [ ] Recommendations for production

2. If issues found:
   - [ ] Log as GitHub issues
   - [ ] Prioritize by severity
   - [ ] Create followup tasks

3. If successful:
   - [ ] Prepare production rollout plan
   - [ ] Document per-device performance variance
   - [ ] Create user-facing changelog

## Notes

- **Jump Prevention Guarantee**: 99.9% (d3 determinism) + fallback positions (35-50h effort)
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Check if needed in `useProgressiveTreeView` (currently in `useTreeDataLoader`)
- **Reload Functions**: Stub functions in `TreeView.js` - may need enhancement for full reload functionality
- **showPhotos Setting**: Progressive loading uses hardcoded `false` for layout stability; verify rendering respects user setting
