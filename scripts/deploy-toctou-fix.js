/**
 * TOCTOU Vulnerability Fix Deployment Script
 * Migration: 20251014230601_fix_parent_validation_toctou
 *
 * SECURITY FIX: Eliminates Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition
 * in parent validation during undo operations.
 *
 * VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED:
 * - Race condition where parent could be deleted between existence check and restore
 * - Window: ~microseconds between SELECT EXISTS and UPDATE operations
 *
 * FIX IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Added row-level locking (FOR UPDATE NOWAIT) during parent validation
 * - Locks held until transaction commits, preventing concurrent deletes
 * - Graceful handling of lock conflicts with user-friendly error messages
 *
 * BEFORE (Vulnerable):
 * ```sql
 * SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = father_id AND deleted_at IS NULL) INTO v_father_exists;
 * -- RACE WINDOW HERE - parent could be deleted by another transaction
 * IF NOT v_father_exists THEN RETURN error; END IF;
 * UPDATE profiles SET father_id = old_father_id WHERE id = profile_id;
 * ```
 *
 * AFTER (Secure):
 * ```sql
 * SELECT id INTO v_father_id FROM profiles
 * WHERE id = father_id AND deleted_at IS NULL
 * FOR UPDATE NOWAIT;  -- Lock prevents deletion until commit
 * IF NOT FOUND THEN RETURN error; END IF;
 * UPDATE profiles SET father_id = old_father_id WHERE id = profile_id;
 * -- Lock released on commit
 * ```
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * - Parent deleted: "الملف الشخصي للأب محذوف. يجب استعادة الأب أولاً."
 * - Parent locked: "الملف الشخصي للأب قيد التعديل. يرجى المحاولة لاحقاً."
 * - Same messages for mother validation
 *
 * PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
 * - Minimal: Locks held only for duration of undo transaction
 * - NOWAIT prevents deadlocks and provides immediate feedback
 * - Lock contention unlikely in normal usage patterns
 *
 * TESTING:
 * 1. Verify parent validation succeeds with valid parents
 * 2. Verify error when parent is deleted before undo
 * 3. Verify graceful handling of concurrent parent edits
 * 4. Verify lock released after transaction completes
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT STATUS: ✅ DEPLOYED
 * - Migration applied successfully
 * - Function updated with CRITICAL FIX #4
 * - Verified via schema inspection
