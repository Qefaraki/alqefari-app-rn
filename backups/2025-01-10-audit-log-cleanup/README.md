## Current Active Component

✅ **ActivityLogDashboard** (`src/screens/admin/ActivityLogDashboard.js`)
- **Size**: 1,032 lines
- **Used by**: `AdminDashboardUltraOptimized.js`
- **Features**:
  - Stats cards
  - Search functionality
  - Filters (tree, marriages, photos, admin, critical)
  - Expandable cards
  - Real-time updates

## Verification Steps Taken

1. ✅ Searched for all imports - none found
2. ✅ Checked navigation registrations - none found
3. ✅ Verified app/ directory - no references
4. ✅ Checked NavigationController - not used
5. ✅ Searched all source files - only self-references

## Reason for Removal

These components were duplicate implementations of the audit log feature. The app now uses a single, unified `ActivityLogDashboard` component which consolidates all the functionality.

## Restoration

If needed, these files can be restored from this backup directory.
